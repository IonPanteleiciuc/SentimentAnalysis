    "1. Explore and understand the **S**tanford **Qu**estion **A**nswering **D**ataset [Squad](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1264/) dataset and the associated task.  \n",
    "2. Adapt this dataset for a *local* semantic search task and propose an appropriate evaluation metric:\n",
    "    - Implement a simple baseline based on **TF-IDF**.\n",
    "    - Use a pre-trained transformer-based model, and fine-tune it.\n",
    "3. Test these approaches on the [CommonSense QA](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1421/) dataset. \n",
    "4. Adapt these approaches for a *global* semantic search task on the [WikiQA](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1237/) dataset for open domain question answering.\n",
    "5. **Bonus** (Optional) Apply a model (any, as long as it's running) to the original Squad QA task."
