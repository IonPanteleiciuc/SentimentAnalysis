    "\n",
    "1. Explore and understand the **S**tanford **Qu**estion **A**nswering **D**ataset [Squad](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1264/) dataset and the associated task.  \n",
    "2. Adapt this dataset for a *local* semantic search task and propose an appropriate evaluation metric:\n",
    "    - Implement a simple baseline based on **TF-IDF**.\n",
    "    - Use a pre-trained transformer-based model, and fine-tune it.\n",
    "3. Test these approaches on the [CommonSense QA](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1421/) dataset. \n",
    "4. Adapt these approaches for a *global* semantic search task on the [WikiQA](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1237/) dataset for open domain question answering.\n",
    "5. **Bonus** (Optional) Apply a model (any, as long as it's running) to the original Squad QA task."

We are now going to perform a **global** search, as the dataset is open domain: when trying to answer for a question, we will search among all vectors, rather than only the ones representing the context the answer is found in. How would you verify that the model managed to find the right answer ? Let's try to use to very different ways to evaluate how well the approaches work:\n",

Look at the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/faiss_es). Then, implement or use tools implementing the two metrics, and evaluate both approaches."
